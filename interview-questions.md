# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is iteration?

  Your answer: Iteration is like looping.  There are built-in methods such as .map, .filter, .for statements where the function loops through each element within an array based on the paramaters or values called upon.  The iteration process begins with the first element and will continue through each element until the arguement or paramater is satisfied.  Depending on the method or function call, the iteration will either stop at the first element or continue through if necessary.

  Researched answer: Additional things to add to iteration is it is the ability to perform repetitive tasks and that they repeat an action or execute specified code over and over until a condition is met.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The predefined parameters in .map are value, index, and array.  I know they have to be listed in this specific iteration order when calling on each specifed parameter.  Value is a required paramater, while index and array are optional.  

  Researched answer: After researching the built in method .map the function has to take in at least one argument and since value is required it is necessary, but the method can take on two or three paramaters.  They just have to be listed in the appropriate order with value first, index if needed, then array. 



3. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: I would say destructuring is a way to identify a specific object within the predefined object keys or values.  Creating a line of code that can define or declare a new variable to pull one or more keys or values from the object data.  I recall creating pet names, pet type, and pet age as an array within an object, then we were able to declare pet info to be only the name and type.  I'm thinking that this can be declared as a variable and consoled or maybe create a function to return specific object data.

  Researched answer: After further research it seems that destructuring is a special way of assigning variables and that it allows us to take object data and unpack their specific values into more idependent variables.  I like how the syllabus says that it is taking properties of an object and turning them into individual recallable variables.  



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: I'm thinking that a function is a specific code that is created to be called upon different arguments or paramaters in order to execute or call upon the function to return a specific output or result.  A method is more of a predefined function or built-in argument add-on that can call on specific data within the function.

  Researched answer: So, after more research it seems that they both perform a task based on data instructions, however a method associates itself with an object.  In a function the data that is passed is explicit, reusable, and only execute when envoked.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: I remember in class that we said objects are data that contain key, value pairs and that class are the blueprints of an object.  So, once the object data is defined a class allows us to manipulate and call on the key, value pairs in order to be reused once or more depending on the class properties or methods used to envoke specific outputs.

  Researched answer: I keep reading more about classes define the properities of an object and its behavior. And since classes are the blueprints of an object they are used to create the object.  The object is basically the information being defined as the key and value pairs. And, objects can contain functions with them, known as methods.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: I remember reading something about variables can be hoisted, but not classes.  I was trying to figure out how this would work, because to me, hoisting is to lift something up.  I do recall that we created a function with a defined value, array, or string. We later declared a variable after the function that assigned the value, array or string to be called within the function.  So, I'm thinking that this is what hoisting is in JavaScript.  To invoke the variable after the code is defined.

  Researched answer: After research I am still trying to understand this.  Hoisting is when a variable can be used before it is declared or JavaScripts behavior of moving all declaratios to the top of the current scope.  I'm guessing that hoisting is a way to test and assign values before declaring them.  I will have to see more of this to understand the purpose and how hoisting works.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: Using a predefined Class and extending its information or inheriting the information to create an additional class without the need to repeat the information previously defined.  Using the realationships within a class to create another class that takes on some of its attributes or behaviors.

2. React: Developed by Facebook and is the industry standard as an open source front end library that uses JSX (a large hybrid JavaScript/HTML library) for building user interfaces and being able to view text level code imput with almost seemless website refresh functionality for actually seeing your code input during development.

3. React state: How React uses JavaScript objects in order to create and store functions as component files seperately, however they are imported to the main Apps.js file to be called by compent in order to maintain fluidity and simplicity without over crowding the Apps file.

4. React lifecycle methods: built-in methods that are specific to React and used in a specific way and a certain order to operate on components through the duration of the DOM

5. DOM: the document object model is designed to be used with any programing language and is an application program interface that defines the logical structure of documents.
